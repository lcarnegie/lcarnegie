I'm a data analyst and product designer. I studied a Bachelor of Information at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), with an emphasis on Data Science and User Experience Design, along with modules in Economics/Business/Computer Science. I'm very passionate about Large Language Models and how they can facilitate communicating complex data to wide audiences.

In my free time, I love anything to do with music and in my free time I play Trombone/Piano/Guitar and try to write my own songs (without LLMs). I also like messing around with code to solve my everyday problems.
