### Hi! My name is Luca Carnegie. 

I am a data analyst and product designer. I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s Bachelor of Information program, where I studied Design, Data Science and Tech Policy, coupled with coursework in Economics and Mathematics. This makes me both able to be a, effective technical contributor to teams and gave me good practice in communicating complex, interdisciplinary topics to people in an accessible way. I've currently been working a lot on Language Model stuff, which I'm primarily helping the Canadian Urban Institute with at this moment.

In my free time, I love solving my everyday problems with electronics, 3D printing, code and LLMs when I can. I also love anything to do with music (currently learning guitar!) and in my free time I play Trombone/Piano/Guitar and try to write my own songs (without LLMs (: ). Bring on your recommendations and requests!
