### Hi there! My name is Luca Carnegie. 

I am an aspiring product designer and a third year Bachelor of Information (B.I.) student at the University of Toronto. My main interest is UX right now, but I love to dabble in Data Science (I have a background in Economics). I also love feeling smart every now and then by solving problems with electronics, 3D printing, and code. 

🈂️ Languages: R, Python, Java, JavaScript, Vue.js, Arduino C++, HTML/CSS
