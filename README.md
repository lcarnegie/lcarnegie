### Hi! My name is Luca Carnegie. 

I am a data analyst and product designer. I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I studied Information and User Experience Design, Economics, and Data Science. I think this is pretty cool because I have both technical/quantitative chops and the ability to explain numbers to people in an accessible way.

In my free time, I love solving my everyday annoyances with electronics, 3D printing, and code when I can. I also love anything to do with music (currently: Sam Cooke) and in my free time I play Trombone and try to write my own songs. Please send recommendations and playlists if you please!

💾 Programming Languages: R, Python, SQL (novice), Java, JavaScript, Arduino, HTML/CSS

🧑🏻 Human Languages: English (native), French (CEFR B2 level), Italian (CEFR A2 level), and Spanish (CEFR A2 level).
