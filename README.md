### Hi! Bonjour! Hola! Ciao! 
### My name is Luca Carnegie. 

I am an aspiring product designer/manager in my third year at the University of Toronto, studying a Bachelor of Information (B.I.). 

My main interest is UX right now, but I love exploring and learning Data Science (I have a background in Economics). I also love solving everyday problems with electronics, 3D printing, and code. 

🈂️ Languages: R, Python, Java, JavaScript, Vue.js, Arduino C++, HTML/CSS
