### Hi there! My name is Luca Carnegie.

I am an emerging UX designer and a third year Bachelor of Information (B.I.) student at the University of Toronto. Though my main interest is UX, I love to feel smart every now and then by solving a problem with code.

Languages: R, Python, Java, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML/CSS
