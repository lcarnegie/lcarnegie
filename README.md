### Hi! My name is Luca Carnegie.

My main interest is Design right now, but I love exploring and learning Data Science (I have a background in Economics). I also love solving my everyday annoyances with electronics, 3D printing, and code. 

💾 Programming Languages: R, Python, SQL (novice), Java, JavaScript, Arduino, HTML/CSS

🧑🏻 Human Languages: English (native), French (CEFR B2 level), Italian (CEFR A2 level), and Spanish (CEFR A2 level).
