### Hi! My name is Luca Carnegie. 

I am a product designer and data analyst. I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I studied a [Bachelor of Information (BI)](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/bachelor-of-information/) in Informatics/Information Sciences, with extra coursework in Economics (yay math :P).

I enjoy learning new techniques in Product (UI/UX) Design and Data Science. I also love solving my everyday annoyances with electronics, 3D printing, and code when I can. I also love anything to do with music (currently: Sam Cooke) and in my free time I play Trombone and try to write my own songs. 

üíæ Programming Languages: R, Python, SQL (novice), Java, JavaScript, Arduino, HTML/CSS

üßëüèª Human Languages: English (native), French (CEFR B2 level), Italian (CEFR A2 level), and Spanish (CEFR A2 level).
