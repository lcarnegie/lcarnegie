### Hi there! My name is Luca Carnegie.

I am a UX designer and a third year Bachelor of Information (B.I.) student at the University of Toronto. Though my main interest is UX right now, I love to dabble in Data Science and love feeling smart every now and then by solving problems with code and electronics.

🈂️ Languages: R, Python, Java, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML/CSS
